The scenario consists of two service providers, namely a web shop (WS) and a 
postal service company (PS). A consumer can purchase products at an online 
website managed by WS. As the shop wants to exclude minors, a consumer needs 
to prove to be older than 18. The web shop supports two credential technologies 
to fulfil that prerequisite. Either the consumer uses a basic electronic 
identity card or a more privacy-friendly one. We assume that the former consists
of an X.509 certificate which embeds the customer's name, address, date of 
birth (DoB), and social security number (SSN), and the latter can be an 
anonymous credential which contains the same attributes. Anonymous credentials 
allow to selectively disclose attributes. More specifically, a user can prove to 
be older than 18 without revealing his date of birth. Students can purchase 
goods at a reduced prize if they show their electronic student card. It consists
of an X.509 certificate with the student's name, address, and institute as
attributes. Consumers also need to disclose their email address when they want 
to buy a product. When a purchase transaction is completed, WS sends transaction 
details together with personalized recommendations to the consumer's email 
address. Also, WS shares the order number (OrderNr) and email address (Email) 
with PS, and the user is redirected to PS. The consumer additionally needs to 
fill in his name and address in the registration form provided by PS. PS 
collects the data and sends a unique hyperlink to the user's mailbox which can 
be used to track the delivery status. After delivery, PS informs WS that the 
delivery corresponding to OrderNr was successful. Note that, for simplicity, 
we make abstraction of the data exchanged at communication level.
